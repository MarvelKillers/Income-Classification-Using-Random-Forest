# Income Classification Using Random Forest
 This project applies the Random Forest algorithm to classify individuals' income levels based on demographic and employment-related attributes. Using the Adult dataset, the project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to predict whether a person earns more or less than a specific income threshold based on factors like age, education, occupation, and more. The implementation includes data handling with Pandas, model training with Scikit-Learn, and performance evaluation using accuracy and other metrics.
